To implement the feature of market selection based on location using React.js, we can create a functional component that utilizes React hooks. Specifically, we'll use the `useEffect` hook to perform side effects (like accessing the device's location) and `useState` to manage the component's state. Additionally, we'll use the browser's Geolocation API to get the user's current location.

Here's a basic implementation of the described scenario:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MarketSelector = () => {
  const [market, setMarket] = useState(null);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if the Geolocation API is available
    if (!navigator.geolocation) {
      setError('Geolocation is not supported by your browser');
      return;
    }

    // Function to handle successful retrieval of location
    const handleSuccess = (position) => {
      const { latitude, longitude } = position.coords;
      // Here you would implement logic to determine the market based on the latitude and longitude
      // For demonstration, let's assume a function `getMarketByLocation` exists
      const selectedMarket = getMarketByLocation(latitude, longitude);
      setMarket(selectedMarket);
    };

    // Function to handle errors in retrieving location
    const handleError = (error) => {
      setError(`Error retrieving location: ${error.message}`);
    };

    // Access the device's geographical location
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(handleSuccess, handleError);
  }, []);

  // Dummy function to simulate market selection based on location
  const getMarketByLocation = (latitude, longitude) => {
    // This function would contain logic to map coordinates to a market
    // For simplicity, return a mock market
    return 'Sample Market';
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {error && <p>Error: {error}</p>}
      {market ? (
        <p>Market selected based on your location: {market}</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Determining your market...</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MarketSelector;
```

### Explanation:
- **State Management**: We use `useState` to manage the `market` and `error` states. `market` stores the selected market, while `error` stores any error messages related to geolocation.
- **Effect Hook**: `useEffect` is used to perform the side effect of accessing the device's location when the component mounts.
- **Geolocation API**: We use `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` to get the user's current geographical location. This API requires two callback functions: one for success and one for error handling.
- **Market Selection Logic**: The `getMarketByLocation` function is a placeholder for the logic that maps geographical coordinates to a market. In a real-world scenario, this could involve calling an API or using a predefined mapping.

This code provides a basic framework for market selection based on location, which can be expanded with more sophisticated logic for determining the market.
