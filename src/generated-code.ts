To implement the feature "Market Selection Based on Location" in a Next.js application using TypeScript and server components, you can follow these steps. This example assumes you have a basic understanding of Next.js and how to set up a project. If not, you may want to start with the official Next.js documentation.

Here's a basic implementation:

1. **Set up the Next.js project**: If you haven't already, create a new Next.js project using TypeScript.

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest my-market-app --typescript
   cd my-market-app
   ```

2. **Create a server component**: In Next.js 13, you can create server components by default. We’ll create a page that will handle the market selection based on the user’s location.

3. **Implement the logic**:

   - Use the `getServerSideProps` function to fetch the user's location and determine the market.
   - Create a utility function to map the geographical location to a market.

Here's an example implementation:

```typescript
// utils/location.ts
export const getMarketByLocation = (latitude: number, longitude: number): string => {
  // Mock implementation: Replace this with real logic or API call
  if (latitude > 0) {
    return 'Northern Market';
  } else {
    return 'Southern Market';
  }
};
```

```typescript
// pages/index.tsx
import { GetServerSideProps } from 'next';
import { getMarketByLocation } from '../utils/location';

interface HomeProps {
  market: string;
}

const Home: React.FC<HomeProps> = ({ market }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to {market}</h1>
      <p>We have selected the market based on your current location.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async (context) => {
  // Mock location data: In a real app, you would use a service to get this data
  const latitude = 37.7749; // Example latitude
  const longitude = -122.4194; // Example longitude

  const market = getMarketByLocation(latitude, longitude);

  return {
    props: {
      market,
    },
  };
};

export default Home;
```

### Explanation:

- **`getMarketByLocation`**: This utility function determines the market based on geographical coordinates. In a real-world scenario, you might replace this with an API call or a more complex logic to map locations to markets.

- **`getServerSideProps`**: This Next.js function runs on the server-side and is used to fetch data before rendering the page. Here, it simulates fetching the user's location and then determines the market using the `getMarketByLocation` function.

- **`Home` Component**: This React component receives the market as a prop and displays a welcome message.

### Note:

- **Geolocation**: In a real application, you would need to handle obtaining the user's actual geographical location. This might involve using a third-party service or API to get the user's IP-based location or prompting the user for permission to access their device's GPS.

- **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling for scenarios where location data cannot be retrieved or if the mapping fails.

- **Privacy**: Ensure compliance with privacy regulations when accessing and using location data. Always inform users and obtain necessary permissions.
